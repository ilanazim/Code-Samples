# Code-Samples
Here are a few of my code samples from my Data Science Certificate Program

### Jittered Head Count - Analyze Casino Game Data
* General Data Exploration given information on various caisno games, headcount, and date/time 
* Generate stats and data visuations surrounding data
* Describe major findings

### Parkinsons - Primary Component Regression

About the data: This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.

_Steps:_

* Load the dataset.
* Create the X-matrix (one-hot encoding categorical factors).
* Create the principle components and do a simple plot of the explained variance.
* PCR - Linear regression with the principle components.

### Wine - Machine Learning and Wine Classification 

_Questions Answered_
* What is the percentage of correct classification results (using all attributes)?
* What is the percentage of correct classification results (using a subset of the attributes)?
* What is the AUC of your model?
* Visualize your decision tree
* What is the best AUC that you can achieve?
* Which are the the minimum number of attributes? Why?

### Soccer Game Simulaiton - Write/Run Simulation to Determine Number of Goals Seen

### Monty Hall Probability - How to Win the Prize (most of the time)
From a TV Game Show "Let's Make a Deal," you're given three doors and one prize.
You're then told to pick one door and subsequently shown one of the two remaining doors without the prize.
Do you switch doors from your original door? Does is matter?
* Run 1000 simulations
* log statistics of winning given switch/no switch
* Unit Test
